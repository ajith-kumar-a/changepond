Q. What are types of CSS ?
Q.How many ways you can use CSS?

    => there are three ways to use CSS.
    1. inline CSS   : in starting tag we write style attribute with property and value.

    2. Internal CSS : in html file we use style tag and in that we write css code.
                        -syntax : selector{
                            property : value;
                            property : value;
                        }

    3. External CSS : in this we create a seperate css file and that css file and that css file we imoport in html file by using link tag
                        -syntax : selector{
                            property : value;
                            property : value;
                        }

    * Selector in CSS   : selecting an element
        1. element selector     : in this we use element name to apply css property
        2. group selector       : we can make a group of selector name
        3. id selector (#)      : when we have apply css property to single element only.
        4. class selector(.)    : when we have to appply bunch of css property to multiple element

*Position       : it is use to move element after appling left, right, top, bottom, value.
                -  because every element has by default position : static thats why element will never move aafter      applying left,right, top, botto, value.
position : static ; default
position : relative ; // element can move by using left, right, top and bottom value.
position : absolute; when we want child element must move according its parent element.
           in this case parent element must have position : relative and child element
           must have position : absolute
position : fixed when you have to fix element on view port (Screen);
position : sticky ; it is use to stick element to screen broder.

          it has two value 1 and -1
          1 means high priority
          -1 means low priority
