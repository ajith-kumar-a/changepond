Javascript  : - it is use to add functionality and behaviour int0 webapp.
              - it is interpreted language.
              - it is loosely typed language.

*There are two ways to use Javascript.  
    1. Internal JS  : in html file we use script and in that script we write js code.
    2. External Js  : first we create a seperate js file and that js file we import in html file by using script tag.

*How to display output in JS:
    1. document.write() : - it will display out on webpage
    2. window.alert()   : - it will generate one popup and display output in it. it display output in single line
    3. console.log()    : - it will gives output in browser console or in terminal
    4. innerHTML(DOM)   : - it allows us to insert data inside an element

*Fnction :
- it is a block of code which is use to perform specific task.
-it will execute only when we call it.

* There are mainly two types of function.
    1. Predefine function   : provided by in Javascript
    2. Userdefine Function  : created by user

* Data types in Javascript

there are Two Types of Data 
    1. Premitive datatype : number,String,Boolean,Undefine,null.
    2.Non-Primitive datatype : array , Object.


*ARRAYS :
- it is use to store multiple values with same datatype in single variable.
- in arrays values store on index basis.
- array index always start from zero index.
- array denoted by square bracket[];
- we can access array data outside array by writting arrayName[indedNumber]

*Length of Array : total number of values available in it.
    syntax : arrayName.Length

*array size : total number of index 
    syntax : arrayName.length-1;

*Array Method

*Object data type :
    - it is use to store multiple values with different datatype in single variable
    - in object data store in key and value pair formate.
    - we can access object data outside for that we write object.KeyName.
    - object denoted by {}

*How to change object data;
*Array of Object
*How to display array of object data

*Callback function : Passing one function as an argument inside another is called CallBack Function

*SetTimeout method : it will call another method only once after particular time interval
        - it takes two parameter 
                1. Callback function
                2. time in millisecond


*setInterval method : it will call another method multiple time after particular time interval.
      - it takes two parameter 
                1. Callback function
                2. time in millisecond

*Date and its Method
    - if you want to get date and time in web page by using Javascript for that first we have create objectc of date call
    - syntax : let dataObj = new Date()
    IN Javascript date class return current browser date and time

step 2 
step 3 : open terminal with option gitbash
step 4 : in terminal write 
        git init
step 5 : congigure remote repository with local repository

*Exponentiation operator : it will return power of any number.
        eg : (5**2)

==  : it check onlly value of value are same than it return true result.
=== : it check both value as well as its datatype if both are same then and only the it return true value.


*Hoisting   : it is Javascript default behaviour which moves variable and function declaration at top of page .means we can use variable before declaration of it

* difference between var , let , const

Var :
    - it supports Hoisting concept.
    - we can use variable before declaration of it.
    - we can re-declare it.

let :
    - it does't support Hoisting concept.
    - we can't use variable before declarationof its.
    - we can't re-declare it.

const :
    - It is use to create variablewith constant value.
    - when we declare constant variable at same time we have to intialized it.
    - constant variable valuewill never change on run time.


*Math method    : it is use to perform methematicle operation.
                - provide inbuilt method
                Math.ceil
Æ’ ceil() { [native code] }
Math.ceil(4.1)  => 5
Math.floor(4.9) => 4
Math.round(5.5) => 6
Math.random() => 0.365969974937552
Math.random(0,100) => 0.6329235965677253
Math.round(Math.random()) => 0
Math.round(Math.random()*10) => 2
Math.round(Math.random()*100) => 62

*String and its method 
    - it is collection of character .
    - in string every letter has index number.
    - character index from zero index.
    - in string blank space is also consider string.

*how to find index of searching string
    1. indexOf("searching string",index?);
        - it will return indexOf first occurenses of searching string.
        - it will search string from left to right direction.
        - if searching string not found then it return -1 result.

    2. lastIndexOf("searching string",index?);
        - it will return indexOf last occurenses of searching string.
        - it will search string from right to left direction.
        - if searching string not found then it return -1 result.

    3. Search("searching string");
       - it will return indexOf first occurenses of searching string.
        - it will search string from left to right direction.
        - if searching string not found then it return -1 result.
        - it is faster than indexOf() method.

*how to find part of string from big string
                include         exclude
    4. slice(start-index , end-index?);
        - it will return partial part of string from index number.
        - slice method will search string from left to right when we pass +index
        - slice method will search string from right to left when we pass -index

    5. substring("start-index" , "end-index"?);


    6. substr(start-index , totalcount?);

    7. split(seperate) : it it use to converting string to array
